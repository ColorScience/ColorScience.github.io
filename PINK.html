        <br> All you want in life is unconditional love and to be accepted for who you are by your peers.

<br>
<br>You have an easygoing, approachable energy.
<br>
<br>You come from a place of assuming the good outweighs the bad in everyone and every situation.
<br>
<br>Witty and smart, you sparkle socially particularly in small groups.
<br>
<br>Your caring and encouraging demeanor nurtures your longtime friendships.
<br>
<br>You genuinely revel in the success and happiness of others, especially your friends and family.
<br>
<br>Compassionate, perhaps to a fault, you are the one those closest to you depend on when they need a shoulder to cry on or a boost of confidence.
<br>
<br>The saying about seeing life through rose-colored glasses sums up your pink perspective.
<br>
<br>Peace, harmony, and calmness are important to your daily routine.
<br>
<br>You appreciate letting loose on occasion and enjoy embracing all the fun life has to offer.
