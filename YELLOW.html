    <br>You enjoy learning and sharing knowledge with others, and you feel a need to always express your individuality.

    Love yellow? This shows you have a vivid imagination, nervous energy, neatly-formed thoughts, and a need to help
    the world. However, you tend to be aloof and are shy. You long to be respected and crave admiration for your
    wisdom. You are a safe friend and a reliable confidant.

    <br> One of your most appealing traits is your consistently sunny and fun disposition.
    <br>
    <br>Your optimism is resolute and infectious even in the most trying circumstance.
    <br>
    <br>Ignorance is bliss and you simply refuse to see the glass as half empty.
    <br>
    <br>You have a reputation of leaping before you look. Your impulsiveness sometimes pays off.
    <br>
    <br>While others are stalled by indecisiveness, your spontaneity and willingness to take action positions you
    several steps ahead of the competition.
    <br>
    <br>Your positive nature should not be misconstrued for extreme extraversion.
    <br>
    <br>You prefer tight-knit social circles to extended networks.
    <br>
    <br>Those who know you best describe you as happy, imaginative, and highly intellectual.
