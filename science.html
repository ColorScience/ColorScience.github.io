   Abstract:
In this project I will see which disinfectant works best to clean pet germs. The disinfectants I am using are water, soap, hand sanitizer, and a 1 to 1 ratio of water and vinegar. You will need cu-tips, petri dishes, marker, dirty dog, and your disinfectants. My hypothesis stated that I think hand sanitizer will work best to clean pet germs. I played with my dog for 5 min and then swabbed my hands and then washed my hands with one of the disinfectants and swabbed it again. After I watched it  over the days and I did 3 trials and recorded my data. My prediction came out correct and hand sanitizer killed the most germs with 98% killed.

<p>
Hypothesis:
I think hand sanitizer will work the best to clean pet germs.
</p>






<p>
Data Analysis:

Water was the worst because it only killed 8-12% of the germs. There was only 1 colony that was growing. It killed more germs in Trial 3 than it did in Trials 1 and 2. 

Vinegar was one of the best and killed 81-96% of bacteria. There was 2 types of colonies. It killed the most germs in Trial 3 and the least in Trial 2.

Soap was okay and killed 45-50% of bacteria. There was one type of colony. It killed the most germs in Trial 2 and the least in Trial 1.

Hand Sanitizer was the best and killed 78-98% of germs. There were 2 types of colonies. It killed the most germs in Trial 1 and the least in Trial 3.

Questions

:
<br>Does our body need bacteria?
<br>Does all bacteria look the same?
<br>Why does bacteria only grow on a petri dish?
</p>




<p>
Procedure:
<br>Make a petri dish
<br>Play with your dog for 5 min
<br>Swab your hands after playing with your dog
<br>Wash your hands with one of the disinfectants
<br>Swab your hands again for a before and after
<br>Do with all disinfectants
<br>Do this 3 times for 3 trials
<br>Record your data
</p>
<p>
Application:
My project will help the world in many ways. 3 of those ways are firstly, keeping our hands clean. Secondly, reducing the germs on our hands. Lastly, helping scientist stay clean in labs.

                  1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 91 cells of bacteria 
               After: 79 cells of bacteria

Hand Sanitizer: Killed 84 % of germs
                 2 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 110 cells of bacteria
After: 40 cells of bacteria
Trial 3 
Vinegar: Killed 96 % of germs
                 1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 86 cells of bacteria   
               After: 10 cells of bacteria
<br>
Soap: Killed 48 % of germs
                 1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 110 cells of bacteria    
               After: 55 cells of bacteria
<br>
Water: Killed 12 % of germs
                 1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 92 cells of bacteria
               After: 74 cells of bacteria
<br>
Hand Sanitizer: Killed 78 % of germs
             <br>    1 type(s) of colony(s)
             <br>  Before: 110 cells of bacteria   
              <br> After: 11 cells of bacteria  






Conclusion
My Hypothesis stated hand sanitizer would work best to remove pet germs, and I was correct because hand sanitizer killed 98% of germs better than 96% Vinegar and 50% Soap.
