   Abstract
In this project I will see which disinfectant works best to clean pet germs. The disinfectants I am using are water, soap, hand sanitizer, and a 1 to 1 ratio of water and vinegar. You will need cu-tips, petri dishes, marker, dirty dog, and your disinfectants. My hypothesis stated that I think hand sanitizer will work best to clean pet germs. I played with my dog for 5 min and then swabbed my hands and then washed my hands with one of the disinfectants and swabbed it again. After I watched it  over the days and I did 3 trials and recorded my data. My prediction came out correct and hand sanitizer killed the most germs with 98% killed.

Hypothesis
I think hand sanitizer will work the best to clean pet germs.








Data Analysis

Water: was the worst because it only killed 8-12% of the germs. There was only 1 colony that was growing. It killed more germs in Trial 3 than it did in Trials 1 and 2. 

Vinegar: Was one of the best and killed 81-96% of bacteria. There was 2 types of colonies. It killed the most germs in Trial 3 and the least in Trial 2.

Soap: Was okay and killed 45-50% of bacteria. There was one type of colony. It killed the most germs in Trial 2 and the least in Trial 1.

Hand Sanitizer: Was the best and killed 78-98% of germs. There were 2 types of colonies. It killed the most germs in Trial 1 and the least in Trial 3. 


Materials
                    
Soap
Water
Hands
Vinegar
Cu-Tips
Agar Trays
Hand Sanitizer
Permanent Marker
****Obviously a dirty dog !!!!!!!!!!!****
                Questions
Does our body need bacteria?
Does all bacteria look the same?
Why does bacteria only grow on a petri dish?






Procedure
Make a petri dish
Play with your dog for 5 min
Swab your hands after playing with your dog
Wash your hands with one of the disinfectants
Swab your hands again for a before and after
Do with all disinfectants
Do this 3 times for 3 trials
Record your data

Application

My project will help the world in many ways. 3 of those ways are firstly, keeping our hands clean. Secondly, reducing the germs on our hands. Lastly, helping scientist stay clean in labs.










Trial 1

Vinegar: Killed 82 % of germs
                  1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 79 cells of bacteria  
               After: 15 cells of bacteria

Soap: Killed 45 % of germs
                  1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before:105 cells of bacteria   
               After: 60 cells of bacteria

Water: Killed 8 % of germs
                  1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 90 cells of bacteria   
               After: 81 cells of bacteria

Hand Sanitizer: Killed 78 % of germs
                  1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 110 cells of bacteria    
               After: 11 cells of bacteria
Trial 2

Vinegar: Killed 81 % of germs
                 1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 82 cells of bacteria  
               After: 16 cells of bacteria

Soap: Killed 50% of germs
                 2 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 109 cells of bacteria  
               After: 61 cells of bacteria

Water: Killed 10 % of germs
                  1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 91 cells of bacteria 
               After: 79 cells of bacteria

Hand Sanitizer: Killed 84 % of germs
                 2 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 110 cells of bacteria
After: 40 cells of bacteria
Trial 3 
Vinegar: Killed 96 % of germs
                 1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 86 cells of bacteria   
               After: 10 cells of bacteria
<br>
Soap: Killed 48 % of germs
                 1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 110 cells of bacteria    
               After: 55 cells of bacteria
<br>
Water: Killed 12 % of germs
                 1 type(s) of colony(s)
               Before: 92 cells of bacteria
               After: 74 cells of bacteria
<br>
Hand Sanitizer: Killed 78 % of germs
             <br>    1 type(s) of colony(s)
             <br>  Before: 110 cells of bacteria   
              <br> After: 11 cells of bacteria  






Conclusion
My Hypothesis stated hand sanitizer would work best to remove pet germs, and I was correct because hand sanitizer killed 98% of germs better than 96% Vinegar and 50% Soap.
