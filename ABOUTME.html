    Tahoe .Last winter break I went to Lake Tahoe and I learned sking at Tahoe
     donner I went for a second time and I went on a really big one but the day
     we left the next day the eagle rock was open!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    I was devasted. I also love skating. My friend taught his sister and at
    Christmas I got a pair of skates. She taught me. My brother tried but he fell and broke his arm.
